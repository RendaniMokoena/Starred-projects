# Starred-projects

1. Java script 30

- I chose this project because I'm interested in learning Java Script, so it has 30 days with 30 tutorials with helping me learn java in 30 days. Which I'm so excited about.

 2. Cybersecurity
  
- I'm mostly excited about this one because it teaches you about the dangers to look out for when it comes to the real world. You can read about how to protect yourself from cyberthreats or for recognising what's real and what's not when it comes to people sending emails to scam us.

  3. Python
     
    - I love how she's a woman and teaching us python she has so many cool games and projects using python. It's something I'm keen on learning and implementing.
